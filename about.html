        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Besides programming, I live a pretty active lifestyle.
          I enjoy exploring what the world has to offer starting in the Pacific NorthWest.
          I hike regardless of season, rock climb (when it's not raining or freezing), backpacking and camping.
          I hope to get into mountaineering once I've established a career and could actually afford the gear.
        </p>
        <p>I love the outdoors, but I am definitely a city girl. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, I cannot
           picture myself outside of the city for long. I love the selection of goods that cities have to offer.
           I am a huge consumer of FOOD. I'm always out and about, hanging out with friends, and eating. I try not
           to spend too much time indoors since I do that during the rainy season anyway.
        </p>
        <p> Fun Fact: I got into rock climbing while watching American Ninja Warrior.
          I was amazed at how strong the contestants' upper body and decided I wanted
          a stronger upper body. You won't see me on the show, maybe later, because I
          found out I could eat pretty much anything if I just rock climb.
